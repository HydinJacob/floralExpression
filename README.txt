Enzo's Floral Expressions

It is a landing page for my future company with some general informations about our story to become a florist, 
the products we are intrested to deliver and a little info about our growing up team.




Technologies were used  HTML, and CSS.

In this web age I concentrated to make this as a responsive web page with Flex box in CSS.
